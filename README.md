# My kovaaks themes, sounds, crosshairs and pallete!

Place Palette.ini into "C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\FPSAimTrainer\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor"

Place Sounds & Crosshairs into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer"

Finally place themes into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer\Saved\SaveGames"



If you are on Linux its basically the same for sounds, crosshairs and themes but you have to put the palette.ini into compatdata the appid is 824270!
